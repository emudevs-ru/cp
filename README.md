# Central (Admin) Panel
Domain: cp.emudevs.ru

Duration: 6 months

Languages: Perl, PHP, Java Script (jQuery or NodeJS)


# The essence of the project:
We create a universal, multi-game, multi-language admin platform. In which administrators using a monthly subscription will be able to manage their server for any game (the list of games should expand).

# Suggested algorithm:
Our service In the context, we simply call the panel refers to the server on which our script/apiclient/add-in is installed In the context, we simply call thescript (depending on the game and operating system) and gives a command to perform some actions and awaiting an answer. In this case, the script must accept requests strictly from a specific address and strictly in encrypted form. The script should not contain (only if possible) a pre-prepared list of actions since the panel will be constantly updated and supplemented.

# What is the advantage:
A fully finished product for a modest $15 per month. No problems installing and supporting any version/season/kernel/os.

# What I want to get from you:
Know that you are ready to help with the script for those games in which you understand and in those programming languages that you know.

# What will you get from this project:
A monthly salary, albeit small for the first time, but with prospects.

PRINCIPLE OF WORK SHOULD BE SECRET. DO NOT DISCLOSE ANYONE, OTHERWISE WILL SCREAM.
